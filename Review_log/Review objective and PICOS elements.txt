Review objective:
The objective of this review is to determine how to use Brain-Computer-Interface 
reduce the risk of fall on older people.

Participants:
Studies of participants(age 65+) diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment
Studies of participants(age 65+) who experienced a single fall or had reported problem with 
gait of balance
Studies of participants(age 65+) dwelling in community, long-term care home, nursing home
and geriatric care.

Intervention:
Fall risk assessment tools before intervention
Brain-Computer-Interface neurofeedback treatment on cognitive diseases

Outcomes:
Identify and bridge the knowledge gap between cognitive function and risk of falls.
Develop a method to use BCI for neurofeedback training for risk of fall reduction on elderly.

Study design
Cohort studies, controlled trails. Case series and case reports are excluded from the review 
owing to the high potentialfor bias in these study designs. Case-control studies are also excluded

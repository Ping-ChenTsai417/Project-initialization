\begin{abstract}
Decades of research and experimental studies have investigated strategies to reduce older people fall risk. The electrophysiological signal, electroencephalogram
(EEG),  is a strong basis of brain-computer interface (BCI) for clinical interpretation \cite{Panoulas_2010,Mane_2020}. EEG correlates with human intention \cite{Panoulas_2010}.\\
Objective:The objective of this review is to determine how to use Brain-Computer-Interface 
reducing the risk of fall on older people.\\
Method: A systematic literature on the following database: EBSCOHost, IEEE, PubMed, CINAHL and MEDLINE; 
Timeframe starting from 2010 to 2020;
The search filter applied for fall risk assessment tools
were (Fall*

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
Most BCI applications involves assistive technology that help the disabled people with motor movement or communication to improve their well beings\cite{Kubler_2006}

\subsection{Risk of fall assessment}
% a bit intro
Falls in ageing population is a rising public health problem globally. People aged over 65 years are entitled to higher risk of unintentional fall than younger adults and children, leading to fall-related injuries or even as severe as death \cite{who_2012}. Among fall-experienced elderly, those who residing at home, geriatric patients and inpatients adults are the majority \cite{Jung_2014}. In addition to fall-induced immobility that limits their daily activity, falls pose negative psychosocial effects on elderly such as dependence and social isolation \cite{Scheffer_2008}. Falling injuries also requires clinical interventions, bringing high financial burden to their family. 
% fall risk assessment
To prevent fall of older people, World Health Organization (WHO) suggested effective fall prevention strategies start by exploring variable risk factors and thus develop related healthcare training as well as safer environment to reduce the possibilities for falls \cite{who_2012}. 

Risk factors for falling varies, hence fall risks assessment tools are widely studied and used for more efficient diagnosis for falls. The accuracy and validity of risk assessment tools should be either tested or supported by evidence before putting in use by patients. As early as 1981, one of the first fall risk assessment tool was established based on incident report data \cite{Oulton_1981}. Later, various assessment tool with quantitative indication of fall risk were developed such as the Morse FALL Scale(MFS)\cite{Morse_1989}, the St. Thomas Risk Assessment Tool in falling elderly inpatients(STRATIFY) \cite{Oliver_1997}, Fall Risk Assessment Tool(FRAT) \cite{Nandy_2004}.
%lists of tools reference see \cite{Aranda_Gallardo_2013}).

The environmental settings of the fall event offers clues to specific factors for fall. Hence appropriate selection of risk assessment tool could reveal fall risks and lead to effective fall prevention intervention. In the last decade, many of the emerging fall risk assessment tools were evaluated by retrospective case-control study to identify fall risk factors for older people who are at higher risk of falling. The tools were applied diverse across settings such as in the low-level care facility\cite{van_Schooten_2020}, geriatric care units\cite{Michalcova_2020} and acute care hospital \cite{Chiu_2014, Aryee_2017}. Other novel assessment tools are introduced by multi-factorial statistical approach that incorporate elders' gait performance and cognitive impairment to rate fall risks \cite{Kikkert_2017,Taylor_2018}. An assessment tool may not be suitable for all the settings. For example, the fall risks and factors of older people staying in acute hospital should be assessed differently from those who dwellng in the care community. 
% Gait and balance assessment
In fact, evaluation of gait balance is a part of multifactorial fall risk assessment for the residents of community-residing older people \cite{PreventionofFalls2011}. In 2010, the American Geriatrics Society ad British Geriatrics recommend fall risk assessment for the older people above 65 who experienced a fall or had reported difficulties in gait or balance. Popular tests of gait balance includes Timed up and go (TUG) test, the Berg Balance Scale(BBS), and One-Legged Stance Test (OLST). 

\subsection{Correlation between cognitive decline and risk fall (strong or loose)}
\begin{comment}
\textcolor{blue}{Executive function is the cognitive domain most commonly associated with gait dysfunction. Attention, sensory integration, and motor planning
are the sub-domains of executive function associated with risk of falls through gait dysfunction, whereas cognitive flexibility, judgement, and inhibitory control affect risk of falls through risk-taking behaviour\cite{Zhang_2019}}

\textcolor{blue}{Common tests of general sensori-motor function and balance in community-dwelling older adults include postural sway assessments, limit of stability tests, gait function (e.g. speed and variability), timed-up-and-go test (TUG), Berg Balance Scale, Tinetti Test and the physiological profile assessment (PPA). \cite{Carty_2014}}
\end{comment}

Poorer gait in older people is associated with falls and limited mobility in daily life. Ageing process causes brain shrinking that damages brain structure resulting in cognitive impairments. Cognitively impaired older people have been shown to have lower capability in gait control, which leads to abnormalities of balance and inability to recover from loss of balance \cite{Thelen_1997} hence falling \cite{Martin_2012, Carty_2014}. Cognitive declines cause neurocognitive disorders in the brain central nervous system with diverse clinical diagnoses such as traumatic brain injury,frontotemporal degeneration and Alzheimer disease, to name a few. The commonly shared characteristics of neurocognitive disorders on older people are declines in execution function (working memory,  sensory integration, motor planning),social and cognition, perceptual-motor coordination, and other cognitive factors such as complex attention \cite{Sachdev_2014}. Execution functions, complex attention and perceptual-motor function are the three most relevant principal domains of cognitive function to fall risks due to their significant involvement in neural pathways of motor system \cite{Zhang_2019}. 

\textbf{Execution function:}

Standing and walking is attention-demanding, high-level, goal-directed controlled task. Clinical and research study in the recent years has establish appreciated evidence of correlation between execution functions and limb movements that produce gait \cite{Yogev_Seligmann_2007}.
% subtrate in brain that affected
\textcolor{blue}{The area of the prefrontal
lobe and, in particular, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
(DLPFC, Brodmann’s area 9) and the cingulate cortex
(e.g., the anterior cingulate: ACC, Brodmann’s areas 24,
32) have been related to the cognitive aspects of EF \cite{Yogev_Seligmann_2007}}

\subsection{Using BCI to reduce cognitive decline:}

Motor BCI translates neural signals from the motor areas of the cerebral cortex. Decoding algorithm is developed to interpret the motor-associated cortical activity.(to be justified!!!)

Investigate effective modalities to simulate the organization 
of brain functional networks and manipulate neural activities by signal processing. Bandpassing neural signals allows to keep a combinations of frequency which give access to certain brain activity components, the action potentials in cortical area. The manipulated activities by BCI 
could be modulated volitionally which is subject to neuralfeedback training strategy.
